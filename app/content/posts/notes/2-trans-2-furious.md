Good news: I'm back on my bullshit. 

I have a piece being published in the all-trans _Fast & Furious_ fanzine 2 Trans 2 Furious. It's titled _A Walking Tour of the First Act Car Chase in_ Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw, it did mean I had to rewatch _Hobbs & Shaw_ in order to write it, and I think it's a testament to how much I enjoyed being a part of the zine that I would say it was worth doing that.

If you live in the US you can [preorder a physical copy through Big Cartel now](https://2trans2furious.bigcartel.com/product/2-trans-2-furious-zine), otherwise a PDF ebook will be available soon.
